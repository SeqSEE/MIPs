# Metrix Improvement Proposals
People wishing to submit MIPs, first should propose their idea or document in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/TheLindaProjectInc/MIPs/discussions). After discussion, please open a PR. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.

Having a MIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the MetrixCoin users.
